## 예제<br>
* [6-01](https://github.com/RyanJeong/C/tree/master/chapter6/exercise6-01) : Our version of getword does not properly handle underscores, string constants, comments, or preprocessor control lines. Write a better version.<br>

* [6-02](https://github.com/RyanJeong/C/tree/master/chapter6/exercise6-02) : Write a program that reads a C program and prints in alphabetical order each group of variable names that are identical in the first 6 characters but different somewhere thereafter. Don't count words within strings and comments. Make 6 a parameter that can be set from the command line.<br>

* [6-03](https://github.com/RyanJeong/C/tree/master/chapter6/exercise6-03) : Write a cross-referencer that prints a list of all words in a document, and, for each word, a list of the line numbers on which it occurs. Remove noise words like "the," "and," and so on.<br>

* [6-04](https://github.com/RyanJeong/C/tree/master/chapter6/exercise6-04) : Write a program that prints the distinct words in its input sorted into decreasing order of frequency of occurrence. Precede each word by its count.<br>
