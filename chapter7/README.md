## 예제<br>
* [7-01](https://github.com/RyanJeong/C/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7-01) : Write a program that converts upper case to lower or lower case to upper, depending on the name it is invoked with, as found in argv[0].<br>

* [7-02](https://github.com/RyanJeong/C/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7-02) : Write a program that will print arbitrary input in a sensible way. As a minimum, it should print non-graphic characters in octal or hexadecimal according to local custom, and break long text lines.<br>

* [7-03](https://github.com/RyanJeong/C/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7-03) : Revise minprintf to handle more of the facilities of printf.<br>

* [7-04](https://github.com/RyanJeong/C/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7-04) : Write a private version of scanf analogous to minprintf from the previous section.<br>

* [7-05](https://github.com/RyanJeong/C/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7-05) : Rewrite the postfix calculator of Chapter 4 to use scanf and/or sscanf to do the input and number conversion.<br>

* [7-06](https://github.com/RyanJeong/C/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7-06) : Write a program to compare two files, printing the first line where they differ.<br>

* [7-07](https://github.com/RyanJeong/C/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7-07) : Modify the pattern finding program of Chapter 5 to take its input from a set of named files or, if no files are named as arguments, from the standard input. Should the file name be printed when a matching line is found?<br>

* [7-08](https://github.com/RyanJeong/C/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7-08) : Write a program to print a set of files, starting each new one on a new page, with a title and a running page count for each file.<br>

* [7-09](https://github.com/RyanJeong/C/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7-09) :Functions like isupper can be implemented to save space or to save time. Explore both possibilities.<br>
